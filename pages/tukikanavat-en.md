Open developer communities form the support channel for the Digitraffic service. The communities operate on open Google discussion groups where all discussion is public. The specialists from Fintraffic and the service supplier for the Digitraffic service are involved in the communities. The discussion groups are also used to announce new API features and maintenance breaks.
