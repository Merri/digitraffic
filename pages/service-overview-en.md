Digitraffic is a service operated by the Finnish Transport Agency offering real time traffic information. Currently the service covers information about road, rail and marine traffic. The information is open data, which is distributed through open APIs. As a term Digitraffic refers to digital traffic, a model representing traffic.

The development of Digitraffic started in 2002 as a joint [project](http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/proj6/fits/julkaisut/hanke3/FITS_30.pdf) between VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University), with a goal to produce improved services for traffic telematics. 
After the research phase Digitraffic was transferred to the Finnish road aministration and later on, to  the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment of Southeast Finland. The Finnsh transport Agency has managed Digitraffic since 2014. Since then, Digitraffic has become fully open data and expanded to cover information from rail and marine traffic. 

The information distributed through Digitraffic is based on data collected by the Finnish Transport Agency. The Finnish Transport Agency collects data for operative purposes and shares the data accoring to open data principles. Using the data is free and does not require a contract with the Finnish Transport Agency. However, the [licensing terms](https://www.liikennevirasto.fi/web/en/open-data/terms-of-use) must be followed.
